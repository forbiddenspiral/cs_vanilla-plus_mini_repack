  File: Experimental_AI.cfg

This configuration controls the installation and tweaking of 
third-party AI enhancements and tweaks.  They have not been 
fully tested.

===============
NPC Smart Flashlights

You can allow NPCs to turn off their flashlights if they 
perceive an enemy while underground or at night.  This might 
actually improve framerate by reducing the load on the video 
card's hardware transform and lighting support during 
firefights, something useful in Pripyat at night.

Note that NPCs can still leave their lights on while on alert, 
if they don't see any enemies.
